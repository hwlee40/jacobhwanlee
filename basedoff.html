In 2019, I was one of the 100,000 who reluctantly enlisted for the military service. Before long, I was assigned a date and base where I would be receiving bootcamp training. I was, of course, curious about this base where I would be spending my next 1.5 years at. And carrying out my research online, I was quick to abandon the catastrophic mess that is the ROKA homepage and ended up scrapping bits of information here and there from online forums and blogs. <br><br> Back then, I took it for granted that practical information about the military service could not be found online. But as I talked to more people, I realized that this issue was common amongst other enlistees who had also come to the military not knowing much of what to expect. <br><br> So if the ROKA won’t provide the information necessary for future enlistees, why not make one for them myself. Basedoff is an information platform for future enlistees who deserve to know what to expect when enlisting into the military.</div> </div>  <div class="divider"></div> <div class="sectiontitlecontainer"> <div class="sectiontitle">The Problem</div> </div> <div class="prompt scroll sectionbody">How can I redesign the research process of future enlistees to allow them to easily find the right kind of information based on their needs?</div>  <div class="divider"></div> <div class="sectiontitlecontainer"> <div class="sectiontitle">Process</div> </div> <div class="processcontainer sectionbody"> <div id="clickresearch" class="process scroll"> <div class="processtitle">Research</div> <div class="processdescription">Testing Assumptions | User Interviews | ROKA Homepage | Research Insights | Personas</div> </div> <div id="clickideation" class="process scroll"> <div class="processtitle">Ideation</div> <div class="processdescription">Ideation | Idea Sketches</div> </div> <div id="clickfurtherresearch" class="process scroll"> <div class="processtitle">Further Research</div> <div class="processdescription">New User Group | Persona</div> </div> <div id="clickwireframe" class="process scroll"> <div class="processtitle">Wireframe</div> <div class="processdescription">User Flow Chart | Low Fidelity Wireframe | Wireframe Tests | Test Insights</div> </div> <div id="clickvisualization" class="process scroll"> <div class="processtitle">Visualization</div> <div class="processdescription">Visual Identity</div> </div> <div id="clickprototype" class="process scroll"> <div class="processtitle">Prototype</div> <div class="processdescription">High Fidelity Prototype | UX Showcase | Usability Testing</div> </div> <div id="clickevaluation" class="process scroll"> <div class="processtitle">Evaluation</div> <div class="processdescription">For the Future | Takeaways</div> </div> </div>  <div class="divider"></div> <div class="sectiontitlecontainer"> <div class="sectiontitle">Research</div> </div> <div class="scrolltoresearch sectionbody"> <div class="scroll"> <div class="subtitle">Testing Initial Assumptions</div> <div class="body20">To test my initial assumptions, I sent out a survey to 6 of my platoonmates and 6 friends from South Korea.

I paid more attention than ever to each design chocie I was making and if it aligned with the findings from my research. <br><br> Working on solving a problem I personally experienced was very rewarding. That being said, I found myself at times making assumptions whilst designing due to the mindset that I was also a potential user for Basedoff. Though I was able to pick out and fix a several of these design choices made on assumptions through user tests in between the steps of the project, I am certain there are ones I missed that could make Basedoff less usable for its primary user group. Making design choices on assumption is something I want to pay closer attention to in future projects.</div> </div> <div class="scroll"> <div class="subtitle">For the Future</div> <div class="body20" style="margin-bottom:60px;">Though user satisfaction was 62.5%, I am confident I can shoot for a higher number if I tweak the visual elements of my app. Some of the feedback I recieved from the final round of user tests were that the app seemed a bit crowded. I want to work on establishing a clearer visual hierarchy in the specialties page to solve this issue in the future. <br><br> Additionally, most of the decisions made for Basedoff have been based on the insights gathered through my initial user interviews in the research stage of the project. However, an appropriate next step would be to further test these findings and validate the UX choices that I have made in response to my research insights. Post launch, measuring retention rate by collecting data on how often users use certain features on the app will help validate said insights.</div> </div> </div> <div class="divider"></div> <div class="backtotop title">Back to top</div> </div> </div>  <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script> <script src="src.24619030.js"></script> <script src="https://unpkg.com/flickity@2/dist/flickity.pkgd.min.js"></script> <script src="carousel.8255b99f.js"></script> <script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script> </body></html>
